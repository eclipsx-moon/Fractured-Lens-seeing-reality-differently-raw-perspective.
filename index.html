        </div>
        <div class="card">
         Every story begins with a spark‚Äîsometimes soft, sometimes fierce. Navi‚Äôs began as a whisper in the wind, a small flame in a world too loud, too harsh. Even the quietest sparks can set the world alight.

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          She wasn‚Äôt born with armor; she was born with wonder. The kind of wonder that made her believe every face carried kindness, that goodbyes were temporary, that promises never snapped. She filled rooms with laughter‚Äîlaughter so unshaken it made silence jealous. Her notebooks were crowded with dreams: of places she‚Äôd go, people she‚Äôd meet, versions of herself she would grow into. She thought the world was a wide canvas, waiting for her colors. She didn‚Äôt know some canvases tear. She didn‚Äôt know some people take without returning. But in those early days, she was untouched‚Äîinnocence was not her flaw, it was her rebellion. To believe in joy when the world teaches otherwise is its own kind of strength. That was her first self: whole, bright, unwritten by pain. The girl the world hadn‚Äôt yet broken, the art no one had yet cracked..

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          The world does not knock before it enters. It slammed into her without warning‚Äîharsh, unkind, unapologetic. The laughter that once echoed became the very thing people mocked. Promises snapped like fragile glass. The same hands she trusted left scars that didn‚Äôt show but never healed. This was the chapter where silence replaced songs. Where the mirror stopped being a friend. Where she learned that sometimes, no matter how loud you scream, no one comes. And worse‚Äîsometimes they hear, and they still walk away. She wasn‚Äôt broken all at once; she was broken piece by piece. First her trust. Then her faith. Then her softness. Until she stood there‚Äîshattered, but still standing. The world had taken her innocence, but not her fire. Pain carved her edges sharper, her voice colder. The warrior wasn‚Äôt born‚Äîit was forced out.

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          She didn‚Äôt rise with a roar. She rose in silence. No one saw the nights she stitched herself back together, bleeding through smiles, laughing with a crack in her voice. No one saw the battles she fought inside her own mind, the ones harder than any fist or blade. She was no longer the girl waiting for someone to save her‚Äîshe became the one no one could break again. The world tried to write her as fragile, but she rewrote herself in iron and fire. Her scars became her armour, her tears‚Äîher fuel. She learned to stand alone, not because she wanted to, but because she had to. And when she did, she found a power no one could take away. She wasn‚Äôt the same child of innocence. She wasn‚Äôt just a survivor. She was something more. The Warrior wasn‚Äôt born to be admired. She was born to endure. To fight. To keep walking even when the world kept pushing her down. And though the pain never left, neither did her strength.

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          Legends aren‚Äôt built in comfort‚Äîthey‚Äôre carved out of storms. Navi‚Äôs story didn‚Äôt end with her battles; it began again in the way she left echoes behind. Every word she spoke carried weight, even when people didn‚Äôt listen. Every step she took left a mark, even when no one noticed. She wasn‚Äôt just a girl anymore‚Äîshe became a mirror for others: proof that you can be broken and still blaze. Her laughter was remembered, not because it was perfect, but because it was real. Her silence was feared, not because it was empty, but because it carried truth. She wasn‚Äôt chasing validation anymore; she was the kind of presence you couldn‚Äôt forget even if you tried. Navi became more than her scars. She became a story whispered in quiet rooms, a spark in someone else‚Äôs chest, a lesson that pain does not end you‚Äîit shapes you. And even when she was gone, she didn‚Äôt vanish. She lived in the strength of those who remembered her, in the courage of those who tried because she once dared, and in the quiet fire of every soul who carried her words forward..

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          Some people live and vanish. But Navi was different‚Äîshe became a presence that time itself could not erase. She was the proof that even if the world breaks you, you can rise again, stronger, rawer, realer. She wasn‚Äôt made to be forgotten. She was made to be remembered in the hush between heartbeats, in the fire behind someone else‚Äôs eyes, in the courage of those who dared because she once dared first. And so, Navi‚Äôs story never truly ended. Sparks don‚Äôt die. They become eternal flames.
